## Challenge propose
Our company Teraverso was very successful in launching a mobile game (Android and iOS) in the endless runner genre (“endless runner”, like Subway Surfers), where the main character is a young Brazilian skateboarding medalist.

After the initial success, the company’s executive group intends to make a new investment, seeking to create a new successful game. Developing a complete game costs time and money, and the team wants to have a clearer vision of the best paths to follow.

Seeing the new generation of consoles (Nintendo Switch, Playstation 5 and XBOX Series X) as an opportunity, Teraverso’s CEO asked her team to perform an Exploratory Analysis of data from game launches over the last 40 years to support the company’s strategic decision-making, providing insights into the following aspects:

Game genre (sports, fighting, adventure…).
Launch platform (Xbox, PS, Switch).
Critical reception.
Sales potential by location.
When to launch.
## Why
Apply knowledge of manipulation, cleaning and analysis of a data set in an Exploratory Analysis, starting from raw data and an initial objective to guide business decision-making.
